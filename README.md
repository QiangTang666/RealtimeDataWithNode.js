RealtimeDataWithNode.js
=======================

This a sample project to demo how to build a real time data service by Node.js with existing .Net code or library.

The whole service is built on the Node.js framework. In the meantime I use Socket.io for real time data publish and 
Edge.js to load the .Net library. There is also a simple example web page for demo. This page is created by jQuery
and Highchart to show the real time chart with real time data from node.js.

Hope this will help you. Enjoy it.
